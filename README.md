#### About Me:
<p>
I am a full stack developer with a demonstrated history of developing, Debugging, and Testing web-based and client-server multi-tier applications.

I love translating business logic into code. Finding the right Design Patterns and discussing them with colleagues gives me satisfaction and ensures that we make each other better at our profession. I enjoy applying Domain Driven Design to convert complex business requirements into code. I develop almost all my code Test Driven.

I mainly see myself as a back-end developer, but through my work, as a web developer, I also have experience with front-end development.
